## Installation

You can install `Datepickerdate` as an NPM package:

```
npm install datepickerdate
```

Or link directly to the [CDN](https://unpkg.com/browse/datepickerdate/):

**CommonJS**

```
<script src="https://unpkg.com/datepickerdate@1.0.12/lib/index.cjs.js"></script>
```

**UMD**

```
<script src="https://unpkg.com/datepickerdate@1.0.12/lib/index.js"></script>
```

**ES Module**

```
<script src="https://unpkg.com/datepickerdate@1.0.12/lib/index.esm.js"></script>
```

## Styles

You can either just use my CSS:

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/datepickerdate@1.0.12/lib/index.css"/>
```

```
// in a css file
@import './node_modules/datepickerdate/lib/index.css';

// js file with bundler(webpack)
import "datepickerdate/lib/index.css";
```
